# CS408 - Lab9.2

## Overview

This project we were given generated balls on a webpage that hit the edges of the webpage and bounce off. We were tasked with creating an evil ball that when it would touch a ball, the ball would disappear. The evil ball moves using wasd keys as most desktop games. 

To interact and see this project, clone it into an IDE that supports live preview. From there start the live preview instance and control the evil ball with wasd keys.
